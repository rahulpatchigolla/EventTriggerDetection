1. Before going through these instructions please perform the instructions upto step 7 in "RNN_ReadMe.txt" file.
2. Run PrePreprocess.sh file to create the folder structure.
3. Copy all the files of ./RNN/Corpus_filtered,./RNN/Preprocessed_Corpus_test,./RNN/Preprocessed_Corpus_train folders into ./FFNN/Corpus_filtered,./FFNN/Preprocessed_Corpus_test,./FFNN/Preprocessed_Corpus_train folders.
4. Run Trigger.py file to train and test the model.
5. Run Process3.py file to get the final F1-scores and the analysis results.
